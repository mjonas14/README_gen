  ## Installation
  The application requires a download of inquirer version 8.2.4, which can be downloaded through running npm I inquirer@8.2.4 in the command line. 

  ## Usage
  The user launches the application by running “node index” in the command line. The user will be prompted with questions in the command line for each of the section in the README. All questions but one require written input, with the exception being the “license” section, where you will have to chose from a list of licenses by writing the number corresponding with the desired license from a list. I advise the user to answer the prompts with as much detail as possible.
